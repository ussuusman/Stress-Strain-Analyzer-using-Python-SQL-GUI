# Stress-Strain-Analyzer-using-Python-SQL-GUI
Developed a Python-based tool to calculate stress, strain, and factor of safety for different materials using an SQLite database. Implemented a Tkinter GUI and Matplotlib visualizations to provide a user-friendly engineering analysis application.

The tool integrates a material property database, plots stressâ€“strain curves, and generates professional PDF reports.

ðŸ”§ Features

GUI Interface using Tkinter for user-friendly interaction

Material Database (SQLite) storing Youngâ€™s Modulus and Yield Strength

Stress & Strain Calculation based on user inputs (Load & Area)

Factor of Safety (FoS) computation

Stressâ€“Strain Graphs plotted using Matplotlib

Automated PDF Report Generation with ReportLab

ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Database: SQLite

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Visualization: Matplotlib

Reporting: ReportLab

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stress-strain-analyzer.git
cd stress-strain-analyzer
